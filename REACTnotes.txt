'npm install express@4 express --save' (will create node_mofules folder and adds entry in dependencies section)
'npm install by' itself installs dependencies based on what package.json says, which also re-installs node_modules folder.


-------------Hello React - Hello React!-------------

<script type="text/javascript" scrc="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/0.14.7/react.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" scrc="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/0.14.7/react-dom.js"></script>

	react.js is for native IOS and Android.
	react-dom.js is for the WEB.

	We will eventually upgrade from script tags to webpack in later sections.

Babel provides supports your ES6 code and compiles it to older ES5 code so older browsers can run it.
To convert JSX into JS or convert ES6 code into ES5 include babel script tag.

-------------Your First React Component!-------------

React component naming convention. 
	- 1st letter is always capitalized.

React.createClass always takes in an object and always requires render.

	var GreeterWord = React.createClass({
		render: function() {
			return (
				// THIS IS JSX
				<div> // root <div>
					<h1>Hello render react!!!</h1>
					<p>This is from the component.</p>
				</div>
			);
		}
	});

	NOTE!! when returning your JSX you have to only return one root element in our example it is the root <div>

-------------Learning JSX-------------
https://babeljs.io.repl

-------------Component properties-------------
'props' is short for properties and it's a way to pass in data into your component when you first start it.

Here we are initializing the Greeter component but not passing data.

	ReactDOM.render(
		<Greeter />, document.getElementById('app')
	);

Do this to pass data via a 'name' property.

	var Greeter = React.createClass({

		getDefaultProps: function() {
			return {
				name: 'React', // This is a prop accessed by this.props.
				message: 'This is React message.'
			};
		},

		render: function() {

			var name = this.props.name; 
			var message = this.props.message;

			return (
				<div>
					<h1>Hello {name}!!</h1> 
					<p>{message + '!!'}</p> // You can concatenate text inside JSX expression.
				</div>
			);
		}
	});

	// You can also pass in variable values just like componet properties. 
	// This means any type is availabe when working with props.
	var firstName = 'Jairo'

	ReactDOM.render(
		<Greeter name={firstName} message='This is prop message.' />, document.getElementById('app')
	);

-------------User Events and Callbacks-------------

'onSubmit' is an  attribute built into React.
It captures everytime a form is submitted and we can pass it a JS expression.
'ref' ia another React builin attribute	

	onButtonClick: function(e) { 
		e.preventDefault(); // Prevents form from causing full browser refresh when its submitted. This is the goal of React for SPAs.
		var name= this.refs.name.value; // tied to ref field from from.
		alert(name);
	},
	.....
	<form onSubmit={this.onButtonClick}>
		<input type="text" ref="name"/>
		<button>Set Name</button>
	</form>

-------------Component State-------------

There are two types of data in a component:	props and state.
	
	- props get passed into a component as you initialize it, the prop is 'name'.
		
		<Greeter name={firstName}
	
	- state is internally maintained and updated by the component. 
	It should not update its own props, but it is allowed to update its own state.
	
	Always answer this:  IS MY COMPONENT GOING TO BE UPDATING THE VALUE?
	To know if I need to use state.

-------------Nested Components: Part 1 & 2-------------

A component cannot update its prop but it can update its state.

It's best to make a static component first, meaning no props or state are being used or passed in.

Presentational component renders something visible to the screen like "Hello Andrew".
They do not maintain state are kind of like dummy components.

The Container component(in red aka parent) do maintain state. 
Red component maintains 'name' state and when changed by blue component it will re-render green component.
It automatically re-renders its children when state changes.

<GreeterForm onNewName={this.handleNewName}/> // the attribute for the child start with 'on' and for the parent it starts with 'handle'.

Only updates the green component because the blue component does not care about the state of its parent.
Whenever you changed state it re-renders.

-------------QUIZ 1-------------

What are React props used for? Initializing a component with data.
What is React state used for? Keeping track of data that changes in a component.
What is a presentational component? A component that uses props to display information.
What is a container component? A component that maintains state & renders child components.
How would you set a components "name" state to "John"? this.setState({name: 'John'}).

-------------What is Webpack?(And installing it.)-------------

WEbpack bundles all of our 3rd party dependencies like babel, react, and reactdom along with app code.
Let's us break components into separate files sort like 'require' in node.

~/REACT/HelloReact$ npm install -g webpack@1.12.13
jairomh@ubuntu64-DevOps:~/REACT/HelloReact$ webpack -h
webpack 1.12.13
Usage: https://webpack.github.io/docs/cli.html

Options:
  --help, -h, -?                                                                                  
  --config                                                                                        
  --context    

~/REACT/HelloReact$ npm install -save react@0.14.7 react-dom@0.14.7

Install local dependencies for dev purposes only and not for production.
        
~/REACT/HelloReact$ npm install --save-dev webpack@1.12.13 babel-core@6.5.1 babel-loader@6.2.2 babel-preset-es2015@6.5.0 babel-preset-react@6.5.0

~/REACT/HelloReact$ webpack ./public/app.js ./public/bundle.js
Hash: ccbca6cc6c5a756e0b3e
Version: webpack 1.12.13
Time: 71ms
    Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
bundle.js  1.47 kB       0  [emitted]  main
   [0] ./public/app.js 79 bytes {0} [built]

-------------What is Webpack?(And installing it.)-------------

webpack.config.js is a very important file that exports an object to let you configure what webpack does.
By adding this in there all you need do is run webpback command without supplying filenames.

	module.exports = {
		entry: './public/app.js',
		output: {
			path: __dirname,
			filename: './public/bundle.js'
		},
		resolve: {
			extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx']
		}
	};


	~/REACT/HelloReact$ webpack
	Hash: 7f675e0aa18af882cb64
	Version: webpack 1.12.13
	Time: 78ms
				Asset     Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
	./public/bundle.js  1.62 kB       0  [emitted]  main
	[0] ./public/app.js 59 bytes {0} [built]
		+ 1 hidden modules <<< 	WHERE THAT FILE IS Greeter.js

After removing the script tags 'React' is not available in app.jsx. When using webpack every file is treated as its own island.
It's not available globally and needs to be imported explicitly.

	var React = require('react');
	var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');

	Run webpack again and you see that there are a lot more dependencies this time.

	~/REACT/HelloReact$ webpack 
	Hash: 84fd7d74053b8bd7605e
	Version: webpack 1.15.0
	Time: 2201ms
				Asset    Size  Chunks             Chunk Names
	./public/bundle.js  683 kB       0  [emitted]  main
		+ 159 hidden modules
